Sub-T is a 22-year-old producer from Berlin dedicated to the sound of early hardcore. His tracks combine the raw energy of the early hardcore era with his own modern sound design. His music is uncompromising, intense, and at the same time deeply rooted in the genre's history—a homage to its roots without dwelling on nostalgia.

Since his first productions, Sub-T has gradually made his mark on the scene—with a sound that works impressively both on the dance floor and in headphones. His sets are characterized by fast BPMs, aggressive kicks, and fast transitions that demonstrate his technical skill and artistic vision.

Whether in the club, at raves, or in the studio: Sub-T stands for authenticity, passion, and the unwavering motto: HARDCORE NEVER DIES
