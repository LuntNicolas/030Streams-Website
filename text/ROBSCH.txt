ROBSCH is a DJ and producer from Berlin. After exploring various music genres in his youth, he fell in love with the freedom and equality of techno raves. He is drawn to the idea that everyone should be free to express their true selves without fear of judgment or discrimination. To him, the dancefloor has always been a space where people can shed their masks, embrace their authentic selves and connect to other people.

ROBSCH’s sets are a journey through sound – blending powerful Peaktime Techno with melodic elements, Goa-inspired rhythms, and energetic vocals. His performances are full of dynamic shifts and unexpected twists, keeping the crowd moving and engaged from start to finish. Genre boundaries blur as he crafts a unique, evolving atmosphere on the dancefloor.

Moving to Berlin in 2023 marked the beginning of fully embracing this lifestyle of freedom and respect for everyone. It was there that he started DJing, immersing himself deeper into the techno scene. After playing gigs in Berlin and internationally, he embarked on his next adventure - producing his own music. Inspired by a wide range of genres and driven by an unwavering passion for sound, his productions reflect his deep love for music.

ROBSCH’s mission is simple: to create moments where people can escape their daily struggles and experience true freedom - free from judgment, free from hate, and completely lost in the music. He firmly believes that it is never too late to start something new if you have real passion and do what you love.
